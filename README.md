## Overview

### The Challenge

## My Process

### Tech Stack

I built this project using the following technologies:

-   Semantic HTML5
-   Custom CSS properties
-   Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
-   Followed a mobile-first workflow
-   JavaScript
-   Utilized [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a JavaScript library

### What I Learned

This was my first full-fledged React project, and it was an exciting journey. Despite my strong background in JavaScript, I enjoyed learning how React components interact and how to manage state between them. Working with React has been a great experience, and I plan to build more projects with it, insha'Allah.

### Future Development

In my ongoing development, I aim to focus on advanced state management and integrating Redux into my future projects. I'm also planning to create more full-stack applications using JavaScript, shifting from my previous experience with Python.
